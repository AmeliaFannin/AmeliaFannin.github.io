<p>After years as an orchestral bassoonist and music teacher, I am looking for a new challenge. Web development offers great opportunities for creative problem solving and a never-ending set of challenges. The strategies that I used to become an expert musician - study, critique, and practice - are just as useful when learning to use a coding language like Ruby or Go.</p>

<p>I started this adventure by learning a little javascript and css, but soon became more interested in Ruby. I have completed a number of Ruby and Rails tutorials, attended RailsBridge Boston, solved the Ruby Exercism.io problems 1-6, and completed the first 50 Project Euler problems in Ruby.  Lately I’ve been picking up a little Go and have used it to solve Eulers 1-7. </p>

<h4 id="education--experience">Education &amp; Experience</h4>
<p>I’ve earned four degrees in music but only my mother calls me “Dr. Fannin.” I worked my way through school in a variety of college office positions, wrangling databases, spreadsheets, regrettable websites, and generally keeping the musicians organized. Before moving to Cambridge a little over a year ago, I taught music at Howard Community College in Columbia, Maryland. I’ve performed with orchestras and opera companies from Florida to Massachusetts but I’m ready to try something new.</p>
