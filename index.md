#### How do you get from Ravel to Ruby?
After years as an orchestral bassoonist and music teacher, I am looking for a new challenge. Software development offers great opportunities for creative problem solving and a never-ending set of challenges. The strategies that I used to become an expert musician - study, critique, and practice - are just as useful when learning a language like Ruby or Go.

I started this adventure by learning a little javascript and css, but soon became more interested in Ruby. Things got serious when I found myself solving math and logic problems to "relax." I have solved the first 50 Project Euler problems in Ruby, completed the Ruby Exercism.io problems 1-6, worked through a number of Ruby and Rails tutorials, and attended RailsBridge Boston. Lately I've been picking up a little Go and have used it to re-solve Eulers 1-7.    


#### Education & Experience

I've earned four music degrees but only my mother calls me "Dr. Fannin." I worked my way through school in a variety of college office positions, wrangling databases, spreadsheets, regrettable websites, and generally keeping the musicians organized. Before moving to Cambridge a little over a year ago, I taught music at Howard Community College in Columbia, Maryland. I've performed with orchestras and opera companies from Florida to Massachusetts but I'm ready to do something different.

####About Me
I can't say I was programming at the age of 3, but I have always loved puzzles, reading, learning, and building things.  When something interests me I like to do the research, get involved, and become an expert. I natter on about gardening and food on my blog, <a href="https://ameliafannin.com/blog" target="blank">ameliafannin.com/blog</a>, and write the monthly newsletter for my community garden.  I like dogs, traveling, trying new foods, arts and crafts, and craft beer.
