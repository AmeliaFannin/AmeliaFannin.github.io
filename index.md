#### About Me

I am an early-career web developer, ready to join a team. I learn quickly - I eat tutorials for breakfast and actually read books about programming. No computer science degree, but the strategies that I used to become an expert orchestral musician - study, critique, and practice - have served me well as a programmer.

#### Background


I've earned four degrees but only my mother calls me "Dr. Fannin." I played and taught the bassoon professionally for about 10 years and am now learning to play the banjo for fun. I'm a Master Gardener, write about gardening on my blog, <a href="http://ameliafannin.com" target="blank">ameliafannin.com</a>, and compile the monthly newsletter for the Rock Meadow Victory Gardens. I grew up in Houston, lived in Dallas, Rochester, Tallahassee, Miami, and Baltimore, but Cambridge feels like home.
