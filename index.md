#### How do you get from Ravel to Ruby?
 

 After years as an orchestral bassoonist and music teacher, I wanted a new challenge. I started by learning a little javascript and css, but soon became interested in Ruby. Things got serious when I found myself coding solutions to math and logic problems for fun. I have solved the first 57 Project Euler problems in Ruby, created a few Rails practice apps, and attended and volunteered with RailsBridge Boston. Lately I've been picking up a little Go and brushing up on Javascript and Python. The strategies that I used to become an expert musician - study, critique, and practice - are just as useful when learning a language like Ruby. A career in software development offers great opportunities for creative problem solving and a never-ending set of challenges -- and no one is required to wear a tuxedo.

####About Me


 When something interests me I like to do the research, get involved, and become an expert. I've earned four music degrees but only my mother calls me "Dr. Fannin." I worked my way through school in a variety of college office positions, wrangling databases, spreadsheets, regrettable websites, and keeping the musicians organized. I have always loved puzzles, reading, learning, and building things. I chatter about gardening on my blog, <a href="http://ameliafannin.com/blog" target="blank">ameliafannin.com/blog</a>, and write the monthly newsletter for the Rock Meadow Victory Gardens.
