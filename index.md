####About Me

 Almost three years ago I began my transition from a career in classical music to programming. I started on the front-end, learning a little javascript, html, and css but soon became interested in ruby and python. I've always loved puzzles, but things got serious when I found myself coding solutions to math and logic problems just for fun. The strategies that I used to become an expert musician - study, critique, and practice - are just as relevant when learning programming. I have created web apps in Rails, Sinatra, and Flask, solved the first 58 Project Euler problems in a variety of languages, and am comfortable working in the command line. My most recent freelance work - an iOS app for gardeners - has sold over 100 copies. I learn quickly - I read the docs, sift through stack-overflow, ask questions, and test things out. I am looking for new challenges, the open exchange of ideas, and the camaraderie of colleagues.

####Background


I've earned four degrees but only my mother calls me "Dr. Fannin." I worked my way through music school in a variety of college office positions, wrangling databases, spreadsheets, regrettable websites, and keeping the musicians organized. I play the bassoon and a bit of banjo. I chatter about gardening and crafts on my blog, <a href="http://ameliafannin.com/blog" target="blank">ameliafannin.com/blog</a>, and compile the monthly newsletter for the Rock Meadow Victory Gardens. After growing up in Houston and living in Dallas, Rochester, Tallahassee, Miami, and Baltimore, I am happy to make my home in Cambridge, MA.
